You will be given a csv file that contains the following headers: cluster_number,predicate,predicate_description,vars,cluster_size

For each cluster, add only three new columns that contain a predicate name and description that accurately represents the cluster as a whole and a list of variables that can be found in the cluster description (similar to the vars column). export the result as a csv.
